# CryptoMessage
This script is a simple tool to cryptograph and decryptograph messages using two different methods.

First Method - Simple key:
The user must use a key (word) to cryptograph a message. It's an automated substitution cypher.

Second Method - Double key:
Just like the first method, but using two keys insted of one. The message is cryptographed one time using the first key and the result is cryptographed a second time using the second key.
This option is recommended if the user wants more security.

The user must know beforehand the needed key.
